				<h2>The Amalgamation of Food & Feeling</h2>
				<p>‘Fooding’ embraces a more casual yet no less serious approach to food that draws on all of the senses. Whilst the food is at the heart of the experience, it is more than simply what appears on the plate; it’s everything else that gives it soul. It's the art of cooking and eating in certain states of mind: celebration, curiosity, comfort, fun, and most of all eating with the times.</p>

				<h2>Martini Lounge</h2>
				<p>A bright open space on the 4th floor, the Martini Lounge has a small terrace for those wanting a breath of ‘fresh air’ and a view of the London skyline.</p>
				
				<p>Of course, the bar prides itself on the best of every cocktail, from a classic Martini to our house specialty Twinkle – but whatever your tipple, this is where we’ll catch you busting moves to the best groove our DJs can chuck at you, any given Friday and Saturday night.</p>
